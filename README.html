<h1>MonoGame.Js</h1>

<p>JavaScript game libary that is based on the XNA/MonoGame API</p>

<p>The only ""dependancies" on modern browsers the API takes is the HTML canvas <br />
object and the addEventListener function. Otherwise the code is valid <br />
ECMAScript 3 code and should work if those two are pollyfilled.</p>

<p>Clown.html contains both a game that is both an example of how to use <br />
MonoGame.Js and is used as a basic test to make sure it works correctly.</p>

<p>There are places where the API is different in more than just ECMAScript ways <br />
(so besides making methods start with lowercase letters):</p>

<ul>
<li>To create a Game class to put your own methods on you use the <br />
Game.createGame(cstr) function which sets up an object for you that you can <br />
set the prototype of to add instance functions to but inherits from the Game <br />
class. The function you pass in will be called as the constructor and can use <br />
this as though it is a constructor.</li>
<li>The initialize, loadContent, contentLoaded, update, draw, unloadContent, and <br />
exit methods are expected to be "replaced" in your game. To call the Game <br />
objects base version call base_[function name], for example base_initialize <br />
for Game's initialize method.</li>
<li>Because textures are loaded asynchronously you just load content in <br />
loadContent and then in contentLoaded do any logic based on that content.</li>
<li>There is no TimeSpan object, instead just plane milliseconds are used. So <br />
for example you instead of gameTime.elapsedGameTime it's<br />
gameTime.elapsedGameMilliseconds.</li>
<li>Remember that Point, Vector2, and Matrix are all copy by ref not copy by <br />
value.</li>
<li>loadSong and loadSoundEffect both can take an array of urls to allow for <br />
mutiple encoding formats to help with cross-browser development.</li>
</ul>
